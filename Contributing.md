# Contributing to IoT Gateway

Thank you for considering contributing to the IoT Gateway project! We appreciate your efforts to improve this project. Please review the following guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow a **Trunk-Based Development** approach:

- **Main Branch (`main`)**:  
  The `main` branch contains the stable codebase. All feature developments and bug fixes are integrated here through Pull Requests.

- **Feature Branches**:  
  For new features or bug fixes, create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name, such as `feature/add-authentication` or `fix/resolve-issue-#42`.

### Pull Requests

To maintain code quality and consistency:

1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   Create a personal fork of the repository.

2. **Create a Feature Branch**:  
   From your fork, create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

3. Implement Changes:
Develop your feature or fix, ensuring adherence to the project's coding standards.


4. Commit Changes:
Write clear and concise commit messages. We use Conventional Commits to automate versioning:

git commit -m "feat: add support for new sensor integration"


5. Push to Your Fork:
Push your changes to your forked repository:

git push origin feature/your-feature-name


6. Open a Pull Request:
Navigate to the main repository and open a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes and reference any related issues.


7. Code Review:
Participate in the review process by addressing feedback and making necessary adjustments.


8. Merge:
Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main branch by a maintainer.

## Versioning

We adhere to Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

MAJOR version when making incompatible API changes.

MINOR version when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.

PATCH version when making backward-compatible bug fixes.


Version numbers are updated automatically based on commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification.


---

## Coding Standards

Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.

Ensure code is well-documented and includes necessary comments.

Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.



---

## Communication

For significant changes, open an issue to discuss your proposal before implementation.

Join our discussion forum for general questions and community engagement.
