### Code Flow
1. **Configuration Loading**:
   - The application starts by loading configurations from `src/config/default.yml` using `ConfigManager`.

2. **Component Initialization**:
   - `IoTGatewayApp` initializes various components like `EventManager`, `CommunicationService`, `DeviceManager`, and `TemperatureMonitor`.

3. **API Server**:
   - `APIServer` is initialized and started, exposing endpoints for device control and temperature readings.

4. **Device Management**:
   - `DeviceManager` initializes devices using `DeviceFactory` and manages device commands through an event-driven approach.

5. **Temperature Monitoring**:
   - `TemperatureMonitor` reads data from sensors, stores readings in the database, and publishes data via MQTT.

6. **Event Handling**:
   - `EventManager` handles publishing and subscribing to events, ensuring asynchronous communication between components.

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**:
  - The project is divided into modules like `adapters`, `api`, `core`, `devices`, `models`, `processing`, `sensors`, and `storage`.

- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Utilizes `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O operations, ensuring efficient handling of multiple tasks.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**:
  - `EventManager` facilitates communication between components through events, promoting loose coupling.

- **Microservices**:
  - The API server and other components like `TemperatureMonitor` and `DeviceManager` operate as independent services.

### Design Patterns
1. **Factory Pattern**:
   - `DeviceFactory` is used to create instances of different device types based on configuration.

2. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - `DeviceManager` ensures a single instance is used throughout the application.

3. **Observer Pattern**:
   - `EventManager` implements the observer pattern to manage event subscriptions and notifications.

4. **Adapter Pattern**:
   - Various adapters (`GPIOAdapter`, `I2CAdapter`, `MQTTAdapter`) abstract the communication with different hardware interfaces.

5. **Command Pattern**:
   - Device commands are encapsulated as objects (`DeviceCommand`), allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.

6. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Components like `TemperatureMonitor` and `DeviceManager` receive dependencies (e.g., adapters, event manager) through their constructors.

This architecture and design ensure the system is modular, scalable, and maintainable. If you have any specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
