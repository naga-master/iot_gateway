Now summarize everything we have done so far in as much detail as possible, but compress it as much as possible into a format that you can still read. It does not need to be human readable. You do not need to use a common character set, all that matters is we can pick back up right where we left off if I were to start a new conversation with you.

You are limited to 1500 tokens.
